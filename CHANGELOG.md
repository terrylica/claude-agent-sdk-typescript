# Changelog

## 0.3.204

- Added `terminal_reason` values `tool_deferred_unavailable` (deferred tool resume found the tool gone — previously an `is_error` result with no reason, read as a clean completion by lifecycle sweeps) and `turn_setup_failed` (the turn-input builder threw before the turn started). Both classify as dead turns, so commands consumed by them report `command_lifecycle` state `cancelled`
- Fixed the post-merge cancel backstop cancelling every member of a coalesced prompt batch when a cancel named only one: uncancelled siblings now re-merge and run (previously they were reported `cancelled` — on remote transports that acknowledged them as processed, silently dropping messages nobody cancelled)
- Added `terminal_reason` values `api_error`, `malformed_tool_use_exhausted`, `budget_exhausted`, and `structured_output_retry_exhausted`. Turns that die on an exhausted-API-retry or malformed-tool-use give-up previously reported `completed`; budget and structured-output exhaustion results previously omitted `terminal_reason`. Commands consumed by such turns now report `command_lifecycle` state `cancelled` instead of `completed` (dup-over-loss)
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.204

## 0.3.203

- Added a `background_tasks_changed` system message with the full set of live background tasks on every membership change, so consumers can track background activity as a level instead of pairing `task_started`/`task_notification` edges
- Fixed stable releases shipping a `sdk.d.ts` with unresolved type references that broke consumer typechecking with `skipLibCheck` disabled

## 0.3.202

- Added `parent_agent_id` field to subagent session messages for building depth-2+ agent trees from disk-persisted metadata
- Fixed `apply_flag_settings` with a non-object settings value crashing the session instead of returning a control error

## 0.3.201

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.201

## 0.3.200

- Added `'manual'` as an accepted alias for the `'default'` permission mode in SDK inputs
- Fixed `onSetPermissionMode` callback not firing for SDK-hosted Remote Control sessions
- Fixed `set_model` control request accepting unrecognized model strings; invalid models are now rejected before latching

## 0.3.199

- Added `requestId` to `canUseTool` callback options for correlating out-of-band permission responses, and support for returning `null` to suppress the SDK's automatic control response
- Added `blocked` field to `workflow_agent` progress events indicating when an agent was blocked by the auto-mode safety classifier
- Added `mode:"mask"` and per-credential `injectHosts` to `sandbox.credentials` settings types for injecting masked credentials into sandboxed commands

## 0.3.198

- Added a runtime warning when `canUseTool` is configured alongside `allowedTools` or `bypassPermissions`, which shadow the callback
- Added per-server `request_timeout_ms` option to `mcp_set_servers` control request
- Fixed `SDKUserMessage.isSynthetic` not being mapped to `isMeta` on ingestion, which could cause synthetic messages to be treated as real user messages
- Fixed workflow progress events silently dropping earliest agents from the list while the phase counter remained correct

## 0.3.197

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.197

## 0.3.196

- Added `prompt_id` field to hook input payloads for correlating hook events with OpenTelemetry prompt-level events
- Fixed control protocol deduplication dropping tool-use IDs after 1000 resolutions, which could cause duplicate `tool_result` deliveries in long-running sessions

## 0.3.195

- Added `Query.reinitialize()` to re-send the initialize control request and redeliver pending permission/dialog prompts after a transport gap
- Fixed `commands_changed` event not being emitted for synced skills when the skill list resolves before the change-detector subscribes

## 0.3.194

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.194

## 0.3.193

- Added `promptSuggestions` option to Browser SDK `query()` to opt the remote CLI into emitting follow-up suggestions
- Fixed brief console window flashes on Windows when spawning CLI subprocesses

## 0.3.192

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.192

## 0.3.191

- Added `old_source` field to `NotebookEdit` tool results for `replace` and `delete` operations, enabling inline diffs
- Added `seven_day_overage_included` to `SDKRateLimitInfo.rateLimitType` for per-model weekly usage limits
- Added `model_scoped` array to usage response for per-model weekly limit windows with utilization and reset times
- Fixed fast mode reverting to standard after the first turn when `settingSources` includes user/project settings

## 0.3.190

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.190

## 0.3.188

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.188

## 0.3.187

- Added `sandbox.credentials` to SDK settings types for configuring credential file and environment variable denial in sandboxed commands

## 0.3.186

- Added `agent_id` field to `can_use_tool` control requests — background agents now forward permission prompts to `canUseTool` instead of auto-denying, and stdin stays open while background tasks are running
- Added `ReadMcpResourceDirTool` tool type to SDK schemas — MCP resource directory listing is now a dedicated tool instead of a fallback inside `ReadMcpResourceTool`
- Added `rewind_conversation` control request for rewinding a conversation to a previous point with durable resume anchor support

## 0.3.185

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.185

## 0.3.184

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.184

## 0.3.183

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.183

## 0.3.182

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.182

## 0.3.181

- Added `errorCode`, `canUserPurchaseCredits`, and `hasChargeableSavedPaymentMethod` fields to `SDKRateLimitInfo` for detecting credits-required rate limits
- Added `tool_use_meta.icon_url` to assistant messages, populated from MCP server directory metadata
- Fixed SDK-hosted Remote Control sessions dropping `file_attachments` from inbound user messages

## 0.3.180

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.180

## 0.3.179

- Added optional `tool_use_meta` sidecar to assistant messages with display-friendly names for tool calls, so SDK consumers can render human-readable labels instead of raw wire names
- Fixed `-p` mode exiting before a completed background agent's notification was delivered, causing interim text to ship as the final result
- Fixed remote (stream-json) sessions appearing busy for the entire duration of a background workflow — the turn result is now emitted at the turn boundary and the session reports idle while background tasks continue

## 0.3.178

- Spawn failures on an existing native binary now explain the likely libc mismatch (musl binary on a glibc host) and suggest `options.pathToClaudeCodeExecutable`
- Permission-denied advisory messages now carry typed denial reasons (`safetyCheck`, `asyncAgent`), enabling SDK consumers to programmatically match denial causes
- Fixed `UserPromptSubmit` hook block feedback not being emitted to the SDK event stream — consumers can now see why a prompt was blocked by a hook instead of a silent hang
- Remote Control workers now send a `worker_shutting_down` system message on graceful exit so remote clients can show why the session ended
- Fixed MCP server-level specs (`mcp__server`, `mcp__server__*`) in `disallowedTools` being silently ignored — they now correctly remove all tools from the named server

## 0.3.177

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.177

## 0.3.176

- Fixed turn `result` messages being dropped when multiple turns complete while a background agent or workflow is running
- Fixed background agent, remote agent, and MCP task state not being restored when resuming a session via the SDK

## 0.3.175

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.175

## 0.3.174

- SDK consumers now receive the `system/model_fallback` message for all fallback triggers — `overloaded`, `server_error`, and `last_resort` in addition to `model_not_found` and `permission_denied` — and the message's `trigger` field gained the `server_error` and `last_resort` values

## 0.3.173

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.173

## 0.3.172

- SDK `plugins` option now accepts `skipMcpDiscovery: true` per plugin, so a host that manages a plugin's MCP connections itself can load skills/hooks from the plugin path without the engine re-reading its `.mcp.json`
- Fixed slash-followed-by-whitespace input (e.g. `/ add tests`) being silently dropped instead of treated as a plain prompt

## 0.3.171

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.171

## 0.3.170

- Added claude-fable-5 model and the fable alias to SDK model types. https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-fable-5-mythos-5
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.170

## 0.3.169

- Added an experimental `usage_EXPERIMENTAL_MAY_CHANGE_DO_NOT_RELY_ON_THIS_API_YET()` method on `Query` returning structured session cost, plan rate-limit, and local usage-behaviors data
- Added an `sse` option (`SSEOptions`) to `BrowserQueryOptions` as an alternative to `websocket`, for browser SDK consumers who prefer Server-Sent Events

## 0.3.168

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.168

## 0.3.167

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.167

## 0.3.166

- Fixed MCP resource tools not being injected for servers added at runtime via the `mcp_set_servers` control request

## 0.3.165

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.165

## 0.3.164

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.164

## 0.3.163

- `stop_task` control requests now return success when the target task is already gone (`not_found` or `not_running`), so SDK clients can reliably prune stale task chips
- Fixed SDK hosts being unable to add builtin MCP servers (e.g. `claude-in-chrome`) via `setMcpServers` when the CLI was launched without them
- Stop and SubagentStop hook events now support `additionalContext` in `hookSpecificOutput`, enabling non-error feedback that continues the turn

## 0.3.162

- Refusal error messages now carry `stop_reason: "refusal"` and `stop_details` on the assistant message and in session transcripts, so SDK consumers can detect refusals without text-matching the error content
- Agent SDK sessions on native builds now default to fast embedded `find`/`grep` search in Bash, matching the interactive CLI, instead of always registering the dedicated Grep/Glob tools. To keep the dedicated tools (e.g. to intercept searches via `canUseTool` or hooks), name them in the `tools` option or reference them in `allowedTools`

## 0.3.161

- The `initialize` control request is now idempotent: a second `initialize` returns the same success payload instead of an `Already initialized` error. `ControlResponse` gains an optional `pending_permission_requests` field, mirroring `ControlErrorResponse`
- `applyFlagSettings` now live-applies `agent` changes: switching the active agent (or passing `null` to reset) takes effect on the next turn in a running session

## 0.3.160

- Fixed SDK hook callbacks swallowing abort signals: aborting during a PostToolUse hook now ends the turn with a final `result` message instead of hanging the calling process

## 0.3.159

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.159

## 0.3.158

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.158

## 0.3.157

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.157

## 0.3.156

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.156

## 0.3.155

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.155

## 0.3.154

- Fixed stdio MCP servers being incorrectly restarted on every reconcile pass due to config-equality false positives

## 0.3.153

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.153

## 0.3.152

- `SessionStart` hooks can now return `reloadSkills: true` to trigger a skill re-scan, and set the session title via `hookSpecificOutput.sessionTitle`
- Added a `MessageDisplay` hook event that lets hooks transform or hide assistant message text as it is displayed

## 0.3.151

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.151

## 0.3.150

- The `api_retry` system message now reports `error: 'overloaded'` for 529 responses, instead of `'rate_limit'` (which is now reserved for 429). Consumers that handled 529 via `error === 'rate_limit'` should also match `'overloaded'`, or switch to `error_status === 529`.
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.150

## 0.3.149

- Fixed `options.env` dropping `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_VERSION` (used for `User-Agent` and telemetry) when a custom environment is supplied, and corrected the `Options.env` docs to state that the value replaces the subprocess environment rather than merging with `process.env`

## 0.3.148

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.148

## 0.3.147

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.147

## 0.3.146

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.146

## 0.3.145

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.145

## 0.3.144

- Assistant messages and `StopFailure` hooks now report `error: 'model_not_found'` when the selected model doesn't exist or isn't available, instead of the generic `'invalid_request'`. The `api_error_status` field on result messages is now documented.
- Added `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/extract` export for `bun build --compile` consumers: import the platform native binary with `with { type: 'file' }`, call `extractFromBunfs(binPath)` to copy it out of the compiled executable's virtual filesystem, and pass the result to `options.pathToClaudeCodeExecutable`

## 0.3.143

- `@anthropic-ai/sdk` and `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` are now `peerDependencies` instead of `dependencies`. Runtime is unaffected (both are bundled); npm/bun/pnpm auto-install them. yarn classic users should add them explicitly for full TypeScript type resolution

## 0.3.142

- **Breaking:** Removed the v2 session API (`unstable_v2_createSession`, `unstable_v2_resumeSession`, `unstable_v2_prompt`, `SDKSession`, `SDKSessionOptions`), deprecated since 0.2.133. Use `query()` — pass an `AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage>` for multi-turn, or `options.resume` to continue a session.
- **Breaking:** MCP servers now connect in the background by default; sessions start immediately and slow servers report `status: "pending"` in `init` until ready. Set `MCP_CONNECTION_NONBLOCKING=0` to restore the old behavior of waiting up to 5s before the first query, or mark a server `alwaysLoad: true` to require it in turn 1.
- **Breaking:** Headless and SDK sessions now use Task tools (`TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskGet` / `TaskList`) instead of `TodoWrite`, deprecated since 0.2.136. Tool consumers should accumulate by task ID instead of replacing a snapshot list.
- Surfaced `request_id`, `subagent_type`, and `task_description` on SDK message types and task system events
- Headless `--sdk-url` sessions now exit non-zero with a stderr diagnostic when the remote transport closes permanently (401/403/404 or WS permanent close), instead of silently exiting 0

## 0.2.141

- `TaskCreateInput`, `TaskCreateOutput`, `TaskGetInput`, `TaskGetOutput`, `TaskUpdateInput`, `TaskUpdateOutput`, `TaskListInput`, and `TaskListOutput` types are now exported from `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/sdk-tools` and included in the `ToolInputSchemas`/`ToolOutputSchemas` unions
- Aligned `@anthropic-ai/sdk` dependency to ^0.93.0

## 0.2.140

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.140

## 0.2.137

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.137

## 0.2.136

- Added `resolveSettings()` (alpha) to inspect effective merged settings without spawning the Claude CLI; reads MDM (plist/HKLM/HKCU) for parity with CLI startup
- Deprecated `TodoWrite` tool — future versions will switch to Task tools (`TaskCreate`, `TaskGet`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskList`)

## 0.2.135

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.135

## 0.2.134

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.134

## 0.2.133

- Deprecated the unstable V2 session API (`unstable_v2_createSession` / `unstable_v2_resumeSession` / `unstable_v2_prompt`) — use `query()` instead
- Deprecated passing `'Skill'` in `allowedTools` — use the `skills` option instead
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.133

## 0.2.132

- Documented `applyFlagSettings()` in the TypeScript Agent SDK reference and added support for `null` on top-level keys to clear flag-settings overrides
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.132

## 0.2.131

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.131

## 0.2.130

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.130

## 0.2.127

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.127

## 0.2.126

- Added `origin` to result messages (`SDKResultSuccess` / `SDKResultError`) — forwards the triggering message's `SDKMessageOrigin` so consumers can distinguish user-prompted results from `task-notification` followups

## 0.2.125

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.125

## 0.2.124

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.124

## 0.2.123

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.123

## 0.2.122

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.122

## 0.2.121

- Added `updatedToolOutput` to `PostToolUseHookSpecificOutput` for replacing tool output on all tools. `updatedMCPToolOutput` is deprecated.

## 0.2.120

- Added `skills` option (`string[] | 'all'`) to control which Skills are loaded into the main session, matching the Python SDK

## 0.2.119

- Added `forwardSubagentText` option to stream subagent text deltas to SDK consumers
- `excludeDynamicSections` now keeps static auto-memory instructions in the cacheable system-prompt block; only the per-user memory directory path and per-machine environment values are relocated to the first user message
- Long-running SDK sessions now reconnect claude.ai-proxied MCP servers after a transport-stream abort
- `SessionStore.append()` failures are now retried up to 3 times with short backoff before the batch is dropped and `mirror_error` is emitted

## 0.2.118

## 0.2.116

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.116

## 0.2.115

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.115

## 0.2.114

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.114

## 0.2.113

- Changed the SDK to spawn a native Claude Code binary (via a per-platform optional dependency) instead of bundled JavaScript
- Added `sessionStore` option (alpha) to `query()` and session helpers for mirroring session transcripts to external storage, with `SessionStore`/`SessionKey`/`SessionStoreEntry` types, `InMemorySessionStore` reference implementation, and `importSessionToStore()` for migrating existing sessions
- Added `deleteSession()` for removing a session from disk or a `SessionStore`
- Added `SDKMirrorErrorMessage` (`subtype: 'mirror_error'`) to the `SDKMessage` union — emitted when a `sessionStore.append()` batch fails
- **Breaking**: `options.env` once again replaces `process.env` for the CLI subprocess instead of overlaying it. To add or override individual variables, pass `env: { ...process.env, MY_VAR: "x" }`
- Added `title` option to `query()` — sets the session title and skips auto-generation
- Added OpenTelemetry trace context propagation — the caller's active trace context is forwarded to the CLI subprocess so spans parent under your distributed trace

## 0.2.112

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.112

## 0.2.111

- Opus 4.7 is now available! This version of the SDK is required to use it.
- `mcp_set_servers` control request: remote (http/sse) server entries can now carry per-tool `permission_policy` values, which are applied to the session's allow/deny rules
- `startup()` and `WarmQuery` are now part of the public TypeScript API
- Changed `options.env` to overlay the inherited `process.env` instead of replacing it

## 0.2.110

- Fixed `unstable_v2_createSession` not respecting `cwd`, `settingSources`, and `allowDangerouslySkipPermissions` options
- Added optional `shouldQuery` field to `SDKUserMessage` — set to `false` to append a user message without triggering an assistant turn; fixed `shouldQuery: false` messages incorrectly triggering auto-title generation, prompt suggestions, and `UserPromptSubmit` hooks
- Auto session-title generation now respects `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_TERMINAL_TITLE`

## 0.2.109

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.109

## 0.2.108

- `SDKStatus` now includes `'requesting'`; when `includePartialMessages` is enabled, a `{type:'system', subtype:'status', status:'requesting'}` message is emitted before each API request in the stream

## 0.2.107

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.107

## 0.2.106

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.106

## 0.2.105

- Added `system/memory_recall` event and `memory_paths` on `system/init` for SDK renderers to surface memory operations
- Fixed `error_max_structured_output_retries` being emitted when the final retry attempt succeeded, discarding valid structured output

## 0.2.102

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.102

## 0.2.101

- Security: bumped `@anthropic-ai/sdk` to `^0.81.0` and `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to `^1.29.0` to resolve GHSA-5474-4w2j-mq4c and transitive hono advisories
- Fixed resume-session temp directory leaking on Windows when subprocess file handles weren't released before cleanup, and on macOS/APFS when `await using` disposal raced its own cleanup callback
- Fixed `MaxListenersExceededWarning` when running 11+ concurrent `query()` calls

## 0.2.100

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.100

## 0.2.99

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.99

- Fixed CJK and other multibyte text being corrupted with U+FFFD in stream-json input/output when chunk boundaries split a UTF-8 sequence
- Fixed MCP server child processes not being cleaned up when an SDK `query()` session ends
- Fixed a failed error-report write crashing the SDK process with `unhandledRejection`
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.94

## 0.2.93

- Added optional `terminal_reason` field to result messages, exposing why the query loop terminated (`completed`, `aborted_tools`, `max_turns`, `blocking_limit`, etc.)
- Added `'auto'` to the public `PermissionMode` type
- Changed `sandbox` option to default `failIfUnavailable` to `true` when `enabled: true` is passed — `query()` will emit an error result and exit if sandbox dependencies are missing, instead of silently running unsandboxed. Set `failIfUnavailable: false` to allow graceful degradation.
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.91

## 0.2.90

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.90

## 0.2.89

- Added `startup()` to pre-warm the CLI subprocess before `query()`, making the first query ~20x faster when startup cost can be paid upfront
- Added `includeSystemMessages` option to `getSessionMessages()` to optionally include system messages in session history
- Added `listSubagents()` and `getSubagentMessages()` functions to retrieve subagent conversation history from sessions
- Added `includeHookEvents` option to enable hook lifecycle messages (`hook_started`, `hook_progress`, `hook_response`) for all hook event types
- Fixed `ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END` errors when single-turn queries with SDK MCP servers or hooks have control responses arriving after the result message
- Fixed Zod v4 field `.describe()` metadata being dropped from `createSdkMcpServer` tool schemas
- Fixed `side_question` returning null on resume before the first turn completes
- Fixed `settingSources` empty array causing `--setting-sources ""` to consume the next CLI flag
- Fixed error result messages (`error_during_execution`, `error_max_turns`, `error_max_budget_usd`) to correctly set `is_error: true` with descriptive messages
- Fixed MCP servers getting permanently stuck in a failed state after a connection race — they now retry on the next message

## 0.2.87

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.87

## 0.2.86

- Added `getContextUsage()` control method to retrieve a breakdown of context window usage by category
- Made `session_id` optional in `SDKUserMessage` type — callers no longer need to provide a session ID when sending user messages, as the SDK assigns one automatically
- Fixed TypeScript types resolving to `any` by adding `@anthropic-ai/sdk` and `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` as dependencies
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.86

## 0.2.85

- Added `reloadPlugins()` SDK method to reload plugins and receive refreshed commands, agents, and MCP server status
- Fixed PreToolUse hooks with `permissionDecision: "ask"` being ignored in SDK mode
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.85

## 0.2.84

- Added `taskBudget` option for API-side token budget awareness, allowing the model to pace tool use within a token limit
- Added `enableChannel()` method and `capabilities` field on `McpServerStatus` for SDK-driven MCP channel activation
- Exported `EffortLevel` type (`'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'max'`) for consumers to reference effort values directly
- Fixed showing "[Request interrupted by user]" for errors that were not caused by user interruption
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.84

## 0.2.83

- Added `seed_read_state` control subtype to seed `readFileState` with `{path, mtime}` so `Edit` works after the originating `Read` was removed from context
- Changed `session_state_changed` events to opt-in: set `CLAUDE_CODE_EMIT_SESSION_STATE_EVENTS=1` to receive them
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.83

## 0.2.82

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.82

## 0.2.81

- Fixed `canUseTool` not providing a working `addRules` suggestion when a write under `.claude/skills/{name}/` hits the bypass-immune safety check
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.81

## 0.2.80

- Fixed `getSessionMessages()` dropping parallel tool results — sessions with parallel tool calls now return all tool_use/tool_result pairs
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.80

## 0.2.79

- Added `'resume'` to the `ExitReason` type for distinguishing resume-triggered session ends in hooks
- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.79

## 0.2.78

- Updated to parity with Claude Code v2.1.78

## 0.2.77

## 0.2.75

- Added `tag` and `createdAt` fields to `SDKSessionInfo`
- Added `getSessionInfo(sessionId, opts?)` for single-session metadata lookup
- Added `offset` option to `listSessions` for pagination
- Added `tagSession(sessionId, tag, opts?)` for tagging session files
- Added `queued_to_running` status to `AgentToolOutput` — returned when `Agent({resume})` targets a still-running agent

## 0.1.0

- **Merged prompt options**: The `customSystemPrompt` and `appendSystemPrompt` fields have been merged into a single `systemPrompt` field for simpler configuration
- **No default system prompt**: The Claude Code system prompt is no longer included by default, giving you full control over agent behavior. To use the Claude Code system prompt, explicitly set:
- **No filesystem settings by default**: Settings files (`settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`), slash commands, and subagents are no longer loaded automatically. This ensures SDK applications have predictable behavior independent of local filesystem configurations
- **Explicit settings control**: Use the new `settingSources` field to specify which settings locations to load: `["user", "project", "local"]`
- **Programmatic subagents**: Subagents can now be defined inline in code using the `agents` option, enabling dynamic agent creation without filesystem dependencies. [Learn more](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/subagents)
- **Session forking**: Resume sessions with the new `forkSession` option to branch conversations and explore different approaches from the same starting point. [Learn more](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/sessions)
- **Granular settings control**: The `settingSources` option gives you fine-grained control over which filesystem settings to load, improving isolation for CI/CD, testing, and production deployments
